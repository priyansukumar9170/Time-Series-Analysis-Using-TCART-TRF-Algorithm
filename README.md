# Time-Series-Analysis-Using-TCART-TRF-Algorithm


This project explores Interval Temporal Random Forests (TRF) for diagnosing COVID-19 using cough and breath recordings. TRF extends Temporal Decision Trees (TDT) and leverages Interval Temporal Logic (ITL) to classify time series data while ensuring interpretability.

📌 Key Highlights

🏆 Objective
Develop a machine learning model to diagnose COVID-19 using time series data.

🔍 Approach
* Uses Interval Temporal Logic (ITL) to handle temporal patterns.
* Extends Temporal Decision Trees (TDT) into Temporal Random Forests (TRF) for better accuracy.
* Combines symbolic and functional learning for interpretability and performance.

🧪 Experiments
* Tested on datasets like NATOPS, LSST, and Cricket.
* Achieved up to 100% accuracy in some cases.
* Analyzed the effect of atemporal features (e.g., cough, fever) on performance.

📊 Results
* TRF models effectively classify time series data.
* Atemporal features improved accuracy in certain cases.
* Demonstrated interpretable rules for COVID-19 diagnosis.

🚀 Future Work
Improve symbolic learning methods.
Enhance interpretation techniques.
Extend to multi-dimensional data analysis for better diagnostics.
